- The client wants their webpage to include accesabiltiy features and to add a Title to be seen in the webpages browser tab.
- To add accesability features and information to assist with screen readers, video captions, and brail keyboards or in instances of the images not rendering on viewers webpage.
- This will allow users with disabilities to know what the images are by reading the alt tags on the images and giving the user a discreption.
- I learned the importance of alt tags and their importance to potential users of a webpage.
